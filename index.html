                            <p>My name is Miguel Chavez Nava. I am a sophmore at Emory University studying computer science and film. I've always had  a fond interest in computers and media so to be able to explore these fields has been exciting. I enjoy learning new things and collaborating with others in order to further my undestanding of programming and computer science.</p>

                    <h4>More Information</h4>
                    <p>Computer science and programming has always been fun for me. I started learning how to program in middle school and from there it has been a lot of fun to create projects and to learn more about how things can be created with technology. The process of figuring out a problem and the different ways to approach through programs and algorithms is why I enjoy computer science. And with a full ride scholarship from Questbridge, I am able to explore a field that I am passionate about, gaining more knowledge and experience as I continue my time at Emory.</p>
                    <p>Outside of that, I have a passion for video games and media in general. I find the whole process of creating an experience through a medium very interesting and I can allow me to creatively express my thoughts.</p>
