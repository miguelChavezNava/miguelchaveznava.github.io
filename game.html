                    <h3>About The Project</h3>
                    <p>I was a part of the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience program at Emory during 2024. In this program, I worked with a mentor as chose a research topic to focus on over the summer. I decided on a history based research project where I researched the Weather Underground, a militant group that protested the Vietnam War and created bombs during the 1960's and 1970's. I researched the history of the group and what it was like for them to be in hiding.</p>
                    <p>My goal for this project was to create a video game experience out of the research I had done. I wanted to build a game that would let the player experience the history of the Weather Underground, allowing them to make their own choices along the way.</p>
                    <p>I used Unity to build this game as I have a lot of experience with the platform from high school. I created multiple short scenes in 3D space with a ton of assets to try and replicate the feel of the 1960's. These different scenes were coded with C# in order to manage all of them, reponding to player actions and choices. This was a choose-your-own-adventure kind of game, so the choices the player made would affect the story, leading to different scenes and endings.</p>
                    <p>This project taught me a lot about research and game development as I tried to create an experience from scratch over a three month period. Although I had some experience in game development before, I had never created a full game so the experience was fun and challenging. I wrote a game design document that outlined the mechanics of the game and a massive story outline for how I wanted the history of the Weather Underground to play out based on choices.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the summer, I uploaded my game online for people to download. The link to check it out is <a target = "_blank" href= "https://miguelchaveznava.itch.io/weathercasters-game">here</a>.</p>
                    <p id = "game-note">*There is only a Windows build for PC avaiable right now.</p>
